# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-
The aim of a handwriting digit recognition model is to identify handwritten digits images in machine readable formats using Logistic Regression. The main objective of this work is to ensure effective and reliable approaches for recognition of handwritten digits.

### Methodology
The whole implementation involoves 
1.importing libraries\\
2.Retrieving data in the program \\
3.Showing Image \\
4.Build a Logistic Regression model \\
5.Analysis of results\\
  (a).Display Misclassified images with Predicted Labels \\
  (b). Confusion metrics
  
### Results 
The model attained the accuracy score of 91 %.
